# Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

Based on the presentation by Greg DeCarlo, here are the key prompt engineering techniques:

1. In-Context Learning
   - Keywords: Emergent abilities, temporary learning, meta-learning
   - Utilize the model's ability to learn from prompts temporarily
   - Adapt prompts based on the specific context of your project

2. Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Prompting
   - Keywords: Task description, example-based learning
   - Zero-Shot: Provide clear task descriptions without examples
   - Few-Shot: Include 2-3 relevant examples before the main task

3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
   - Keywords: Step-by-step reasoning, intermediate steps, logical thinking
   - Guide the model to break down complex problems into smaller steps
   - Useful for tasks requiring multi-step solutions or logical reasoning

4. Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting
   - Keywords: Spatial reasoning, symbol interpretation, text formatting
   - Use random symbols to assist with spatial reasoning in text
   - Helpful for tasks involving layout or structure interpretation

5. Self-Consistency Decoding
   - Keywords: Multiple rollouts, consistency check, reliability
   - Generate multiple CoT solutions and select the most common conclusion
   - Improves reliability for complex reasoning tasks

6. Generated Knowledge Prompting
   - Keywords: Fact generation, contextual information, commonsense reasoning
   - First prompt the model to generate relevant facts, then use these facts in the main prompt
   - Enhances performance on tasks requiring specific knowledge or context

7. Prompt Chaining
   - Keywords: Sequential prompts, task breakdown, structured responses
   - Combine multiple prompts in sequence to guide the model through complex tasks
   - Useful for breaking down projects into manageable steps

8. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
   - Keywords: Multiple paths, evaluation, breadth-first search, beam search
   - Generate and evaluate multiple possible next steps for complex problem-solving
   - Effective for tasks requiring exploration of different solution paths

9. Maieutic Prompting
   - Keywords: Recursive explanations, logical consistency, self-questioning
   - Prompt the model to explain parts of its explanation recursively
   - Improves performance on tasks requiring high logical consistency

10. Least-to-Most Prompting
    - Keywords: Sub-problem listing, sequential solving, task decomposition
    - Guide the model to list sub-problems and solve them in sequence
    - Ideal for breaking down complex challenges into smaller, manageable tasks

11. Complexity-Based Prompting
    - Keywords: Multiple rollouts, longest chains, thoughtful reasoning
    - Generate multiple CoT solutions and select based on complexity and consensus
    - Useful for tasks requiring deep, multi-step reasoning

12. Self-Refinement
    - Keywords: Iterative improvement, self-critique, feedback loop
    - Prompt the model to solve, critique, and refine its own solutions
    - Valuable for iteratively improving project outcomes during the course of the project

More Tips:
- Experiment with combining these techniques based on your specific project needs
- Use CoT and ToT for complex problem-solving and reasoning tasks
- Leverage Few-Shot prompting when you have clear examples of desired outputs
- Apply Self-Consistency and Complexity-Based Prompting for increased reliability in critical components
- Utilize Self-Refinement for iterative improvement of your project
